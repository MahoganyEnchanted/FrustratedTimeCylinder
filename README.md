# Code Refactor Starter Code

I started this project at the end of May and completed it successfully. My only troubles were uploading it. After 
hours and days of research I have finally found a solution. I researched how to clone a code without forking it. Per the instructions, Im supposed to clone the starter code without forking it. I then researched Google, what does "Forking" mean, "It's stated that it shares code and visibility setting with the original "upstream" repo."

Then I reasearched how to clone a repo without forking it. I was directed to Github and read, "Duplicating a Repo."

I mirrored the file and cloned it to vs code. 

Doing this challange was very challenging. I've learned research is important. hahaha
